## Top Step Trader (TST) Market Alerts

- For Trading Week ( ISO-8601 ) #25

**Note**. All ISO-8601 Trading Weeks start on a Monday and end on a Sunday

## Upcoming Day Event and Time

- Monday, June 19, #2017

- Upon the daily close of the market

**Event**. Crude oil rolls from July (N7) to August (Q7)

## Why This Matters

**Rule**. To protect against overt risk and to avoid slippage at execution time, all TST traders should ONLY trade the most active month of an underlying contract.

Therefore, on the Friday before the "roll date" of Monday, June 19th ( Or, before ) ...

**Action**. Roll your long ( or, short ) positions from the expiring July (N7) contracts to the next August (Q7) contracts.

## Other Notable Calendar Event No. 2 For the Week

- Crude Oil Inventories

- Wednesday, June 21, #2017

Crude Oil Inventories will be announced (EIA) at 9:30 AM CDT

## Why it Matters

**Discussion**. The level of Crude Oil inventories in storage directly influences the price of petroleum products, and therefore indirectly impacts growth and inflation.

Generally, a "fat" inventory reading correlates to a weakening in price, and therefore an indirect reduction in inflation expectations.

Expectations of future growth in GDP are also hampered by a "fat" inventory reading.

Why? Because a "fat" inventory reading begs the question ... "Why aren't motorists and corporations drawing down the current stock of crude?"

## Other Notable Calendar Event No. 3 For the Week

- Natural Gas Inventories

- Thursday, June 22, #2017

Natural Gas Inventories will be announced (EIA) at 9:30 AM CDT

**Discussion**. The level of Natural Gas inventories in storage is an indicator of the change in supply from one week to the next week.

## CFTC Rule 4.41

Hypothetical or imulated performance results have certain limitations.

Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.

Also, because the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.

Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight.
